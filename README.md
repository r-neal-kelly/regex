# regex

I have a fascination with regex engines and searching text. I want my regex engine to handle ancient languages as well as modern, so it has to support various types of unicode out of the box, and regex flavor that facilitates use of common unicode points like [Greek], [Hebrew], [Latin], etc.

This is a hobby project. I'm hoping this will help with keep my spirit up. I'm writing it in C because I love the language and also enjoy working within the limitations. There are a lot less options and therefore a lot less to complain about when it comes to the choices I will be making. If nothing else, writing in pure C will do one of two things. Make me dislike modern languages, and learn to appreciate them even more than I do.

Because a regex engine has need of various types, this library will also come with some useful types like a dynamic array, an associative array, a string, UTF encoders and decoders, and a simple allocators.

I don't know if I'll complete this project, at least I don't have any high standards set except that I enjoy myself and my writing in my favorite language of all time: C.
