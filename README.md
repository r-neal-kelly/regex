# regex

I have a fascination with regex engines and searching text. I want my regex engine to handle ancient languages as well as modern, so it has to support various types of unicode out of the box, and a regex flavor that facilitates use of common unicode points like [Greek], [Hebrew], [Latin], etc.

This is a hobby project. I'm hoping this will help keep my spirit up. I'm writing it in C because I love the language and I also enjoy working within the limitations. There are less options and therefore less to complain about when it comes to the choices I will be making. If nothing else, writing in pure C will do one of two things. Either it will make me dislike modern languages, or learn to appreciate them even more than I already do.

Because a regex engine has need of various types, this library will also come with a dynamic array, an associative array, a string, UTF encoders and decoders, and simple allocators.

I don't know if I'll complete this project, at least I don't have any high standards set. I just want to enjoy myself and writing in my favorite language of all time: C.
